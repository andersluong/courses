## Discussions

Answer the question, and don't bring everything you know about asked topic.
Give arguments and some opinions. Correct use of terminology.

Note: lvalues and rvalues are only referred to expressions. int x{}; is not an lvalue
but x is.

A discussion that could come up is given a scenario, discuss the advantages and disadvantages.
Answer each part with 1-2 sentences.

## General

- We have DAT2, it's more intensive on templates and stl instead of polymorphism.
- lang, language, cpp on the link in cppreference.com is blocked
- 0.5 points are rounded up
- If the code doesn't compile, you will get half of the total points deducted on that assignment.
- resonably efficient
- run clang as well, g++-10, clang++-12
- valgrind
- 5h
- search function should work
- not a problem solving exam. There are instructions.

## Point deductions

- use const and references when possible, otherwise point deduction.
- on polymorphism, don't forget virtual destruction
- memory leak gives point deduction

## Study Strategies

1. emulate exam environment when doing old exams
2. don't look at solutions for learning. They are for self-assessment
3. Ask questions
4. Be careful with the resources you use. Be critical.

## During the exam

- Reason about your time and don't spend too much time on each assignment
- Allow yourself to be stuck briefly (about 15 min) else move on
- Get an overview of the exam
- Start with the hardest assignment
- The more text, the easier
- Look at point allocations and don't be scared to read
- Ask when unsure

## Things that will come up

- ranges, algorithm, stl
- concepts
- template things
- some type of polymorphism
- different concepts
